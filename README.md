## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Taochen](https://www.zhihu.com/people/chen-tao-2-78)

<br>

I'm currently working at ByteDance, and I'm working on some interesting stuff like `micro-frontends`, `remote packages` and `low-code`, and a super-efficient `shared development model`. At this stage I am learning some knowledge about compilation. If you are also interested in these, please follow me ðŸ˜€.
