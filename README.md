## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Taochen](https://www.zhihu.com/people/chen-tao-2-78)

<br>

I'm currently working at ByteDance and working on some interesting stuff like micro frontends, remote packages and low-code dx parts, and a super-efficient shared development model. At this stage I am learning some knowledge about compilation. If you are also interested in these, let us create fun works together, please follow me ðŸ˜€.
